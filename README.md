My tutorial repository! yay!
I'm Emily! New to programming and have a little code under my belt. I like to read Young Adult fiction novels and Im a dungeons and dragons player. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades kind of person, but I am in no way a master of all those trades. Just so you know.
